            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
                <li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
                <li>Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <header>what you should know</header>
            <p >This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
            <p>Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</p>
            <p>There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
                &lt; print("Hello World")
            </code>
            <p></p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p >Variables need not be declared first in python. They can be used directly. Variables in python are case-sensitive as most of the other programming languages. </p>
            <code>
                &lt;    a = 3 <br>
                &lt;    A = 4 <br>
                &lt;    print(a) <br>
                &lt;    print(A)

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p >You can declare any name to the variable it is just like a container which is going to be hold a value..</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p >Scope refers to the coding region from which a particular Python object is accessible. Hence one cannot access any particular object from anywhere from the code, the accessing has to be allowed by the scope of the object.</p>
